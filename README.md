## ðŸ§ª How It Works

### 1. **MovieFeedback Component**
- Form input for name, movie selection, rating, and comments
- On submit:
  - Saves data to `localStorage`
  - Redirects to `/reviews`

### 2. **ViewFeedback Component**
- Fetches data from `localStorage`
- Renders list of reviews (or message if empty)
